# Header Slider by Category

A simple yet powerful **WordPress header slider plugin** that displays your latest posts from a chosen category in a **full-width, full-height** looping slider.  
Each slide uses the post’s **featured image** as the background and overlays the **title**, **excerpt**, and **optional call-to-action button** extracted from the post content.
